     <p>I thought "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion" was awesome, with every npc you can talk to and a amazing amazing main story with decent side stories.<br>
    The main story centers around the hier to the throne and you are a prisioner who and has the many tasks of closing the gates of Oblivion trying to be opened by a cult, help the hier to the throne become the emperor.<br>
    I liked the plot because it holds a certain amount of mystery to the story because you dont know what this cult, 'The Mythic Dawn', is, and why they want to open the gates to Oblivion.<br>
    I didn't play all of the side missions, but the side missions I finished I really liked them.<br>
    The things I didnt like about the missions in Oblivion is that most of them have the same structure with lots of fetch quests, whether that be in main quests or side quests, the only thing that kept me interested in the game was the narrative.<br>
    But I thought the graphics and the world of Oblivion were really interesting with high mountain tops aqnd big seas with many caves to explore.</p>
