     <p>I thought "Halo 3: ODST" was awesome because of story, narrative, and atmosphere.<br>
        I like the story of the game because of the characters and with thier personalities being very different and all of them having good chemistry with each other.<br>
        The music is depressing with its slow saxaphones and pianos but when there is action there is electronic guitar songs that I'm not a huge fan of, Bungie focused more of thier efforts on depressing and lonley atmosphere and less on<br>
        action orchestrol like music, and that's why I love it. The game dosent put you in the shoes of a dude who's obviously going to win at the end of the day,<br>
        there's uncertianty to the game through story and atmosphere with dark lit areas, well writen characters, and amazing music..</p>
